# socketexperiment
experiment with socket.io and react
### It's really quite simple
1. get two devices or open two windows on your device so you can see both windows.
2. got to  https://dry-ravine-35632.herokuapp.com/ on each device.
3. enter a color in one of the color boxes and watch the colors change on the other boxes and in the other device!
4. have fun.
